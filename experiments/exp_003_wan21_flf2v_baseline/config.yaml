model:
  # Official Diffusers format model id for Wan FLF2V.
  repo_id: "Wan-AI/Wan2.1-FLF2V-14B-720P-Diffusers"
  torch_dtype: bfloat16
  use_safetensors: true

inputs:
  # Wan prompt style: Opening shot -> Camera motion -> Reveal/payoff + aesthetic control.
  prompt: "Opening shot: the scene starts with the composition and subject style of the first frame. Camera motion: a smooth, cinematic dolly movement with stable temporal continuity, natural parallax, and coherent subject motion through the transition. Reveal/payoff: the scene gradually resolves into the composition, subject arrangement, and mood of the last frame. Keep realistic lighting, clean details, consistent geometry, and filmic color grading without abrupt jumps."
  # Official Wan recommended negative prompt (HF model card style).
  negative_prompt: "bright tones, overexposed, static, blurred details, subtitles, style, works, paintings, images, static, overall gray, worst quality, low quality, JPEG compression residue, ugly, incomplete, extra fingers, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn faces, deformed, disfigured, misshapen limbs, fused fingers, still picture, messy background, three legs, many people in the background, walking backwards"
