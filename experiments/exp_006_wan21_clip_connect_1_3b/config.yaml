# Experiment 006 — Wan 2.1 T2V 1.3B clip-to-clip connecting (prompt grid).
# Runs a 3 clip-pairs × 3 prompts grid (9 total videos).
# Clip pairs include a "cross-clip" pair (start from one source, end from another).

  prompts:
    - "Opening shot: hold the first frame composition for a brief beat. Camera motion: smooth cinematic dolly-in with stable temporal continuity, controlled parallax, and clean geometry. Reveal/payoff: gradually resolve into the final frame composition with natural lighting and coherent subject motion."
    - "Opening shot: start from the first frame exactly. Camera motion: aggressive whip pan from left to right, very fast transition with strong directional motion blur and kinetic energy, then quickly stabilize. Reveal/payoff: lock onto the last frame composition with clear subject structure after the whip movement."
    - "Opening shot: begin from the first frame faithfully. Camera motion: slow orbit/arc movement around the scene with gentle parallax and high temporal smoothness, almost floating camera behavior. Reveal/payoff: settle into the last frame composition with soft filmic continuity and minimal abrupt motion."
